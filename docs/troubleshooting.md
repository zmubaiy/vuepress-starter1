# Troubleshooting VuePress Issues

While VuePress is a robust and reliable static site generator, you may occasionally run into challenges or issues during your usage. This troubleshooting guide is here to help you identify and resolve common problems effectively.

## Problem: Site Not Building

- **Solution**: Check your project's dependencies and ensure VuePress is correctly installed. Verify that your Markdown files and configuration are error-free.

## Problem: Images Not Displaying

- **Solution**: Double-check the file paths to your images. Ensure that image files exist in the specified locations. Use relative paths for images within your project.

## Problem: Navigation Not Updating

- **Solution**: Review your navigation configuration in the `config.js` file. Verify that your routes and links are correctly defined.

## Problem: Customization Issues

- **Solution**: When customizing themes or components, be cautious with syntax errors or typos in your configuration. Check for any conflicting customizations.

## Problem: Deployment Errors

- **Solution**: If you encounter issues during deployment, review your deployment scripts and settings. Ensure you're deploying to the correct server and that your environment is properly configured.

## Problem: SEO Not Optimized

- **Solution**: To improve SEO, double-check your meta tags, titles, and descriptions in your Markdown files. Ensure they are accurately defined and contain relevant keywords.

## Problem: Slow Performance

- **Solution**: Optimize your site's performance by reducing image sizes, minimizing external requests, and caching assets where possible.

## Problem: Plugin Conflicts

- **Solution**: If you experience problems with plugins, confirm compatibility with your VuePress version and other plugins. Check for documentation or updates related to the specific plugin.

## Problem: Unexpected Behavior

- **Solution**: When encountering unexpected behavior, review your code, configurations, and recent changes. Isolate the issue to identify potential causes.

If you cannot resolve an issue despite following the suggested solutions, don't hesitate to seek help from the VuePress community or forums. With patience and persistence, most VuePress challenges can be overcome to create a seamless web experience for your audience.
