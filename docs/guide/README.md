# Introduction

[Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/) is like a supercharged web hosting platform that helps companies and developer teams create and manage their websites faster and more efficiently. It's especially awesome for hosting websites that don't change much.

## Static Site Hosting
Static Site Hosting is all about hosting websites that are made up of pre-built files (like pieces of a puzzle), including things like [HTML](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-html/), [CSS](https://kinsta.com/blog/css-best-practices/), and [JavaScript](https://kinsta.com/javascript/). These websites don't change on the fly; they're ready to go right from the start.

Imagine it like baking cookies ahead of time instead of making them from scratch when someone wants to eat them. With this kind of hosting, web pages are created and put on the internet before anyone even asks for them. When someone does ask for a page, it's served super quickly because there's no need for the server to do extra work. It's like serving cookies that are already baked instead of having to mix the dough and bake them when someone orders them.

In contrast, dynamic websites are like making cookies to order. The server has to mix the dough and bake the cookies when someone asks for them, which takes more time. So, static websites are like the ready-made cookies of the internet world, and Kinsta makes sure they're served lightning fast.
